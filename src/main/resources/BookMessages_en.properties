introduction=<strong>The Job Announcement</strong> is a web application implementing the BPMN business process extensively described as an example in the book <strong><a href\="http\://www.amazon.com/Real-Life-BPMN-Analyze-Automate-Processes/dp/1480034983/">"Real-Life BPMN: Using BPMN 2.0 to Analyze, Improve, and Automate Processes in Your Company"</a></strong>.

process.level.1.title=Job Announcement: Level 1
process.level.1.description=This layer is called the <em>strategic process model</em> or sometimes the <em>logical-abstract model</em>. The main purpose of this level, is to give a very quick understanding of a process even if you have never seen a BPMN diagram before. The process model at this level must be syntactically correct but can be semantically incorrect given that the full details and semantics of the process will be discovered in <em>lower</em> levels. Please note that this application currently implements only the process up to publishing a job announcement (shown as <em>Stellenauschreibung</em> in the Level 1 process diagram below).

process.level.2.title=Job Announcement: Level 2
process.level.2.description=This layer is called the <em>operational process model</em>, or sometimes the <em>physical-concrete model</em>. The process model in this layer clarifies the requirements for IT-solutions in regards to process participants and integration with other systems. The process model at this level must be both syntactically and semantically correct since this level is a pre-requisite to arrive at an executable process at the next level.

process.level.3.title=Job Announcement: Level 3
process.level.3.description=This layer is called the <em>technical process model</em> or <em>executable process</em>. The main purpose of this level is to get the process to be executed by a software process engine.
